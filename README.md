# Code-Snippets
Various helpful code snippets.

These are some code snippets that I created. I have used these bits of code multiple times. You're welcome to make use of the code as well.

### [C# / CSharp](https://github.com/ChadESmith42/Code-Snippets/blob/master/cSharp/CSharp_README.md)
### [Typescript](https://github.com/ChadESmith42/Code-Snippets/blob/master/typescript/README.md)

### Configurations/Useful Data
[Mobile Phone Screen Settings](https://github.com/ChadESmith42/Code-Snippets/blob/master/mobile-device-emulation.md) contains the screen size and resolution for multiple mobile phone models. You can add each device to your browser's deverloper tools to emulate specific models.
